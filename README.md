This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU !

# Background

Hello! I am Mohil (he/his/him) from India. I am a first year Information System Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. Before pursuing my master's, 
I worked at Deloitte as a Technical Consultant. In this role, I have helped stakeholders identify potential areas of Improvement and build an innovative end-to-end solution for critical business problems. My areas of expertise include working on Microsoft Dynamics CRM and Microsoft Dynamics ERP in the public sector domain. I have also led and developed a product for a US-based regulatory body.  I have driven several initiatives for streamlining and automation of routine administrative tasks. This untapped a newfound passion for product management and business consulting. Fun fact, I love to meet new people and work for various social causes by doing my part in giving back to society.

# What I have learnt so far 

We all know that data is everywhere and just designing cool stuff like charts or dashboards isn't sufficient but understanding the story behind it and conveying it in words to the right audience is something that I had learned. I got a chance to learn about new data visualization tools, techniques, and critique methods. I got a deeper understanding of data visualization tools that I already knew about such as Tableau. Since I come from a non-design background I was also able to get a more design-oriented perspective on data visualization. While the visualizations I've created or viewed during my professional career have not been thoughtless, I learned how to add a level of intention to all aspects of my visualizations. I was able to obtain some hands-on training with the tools and techniques. I cannot wait to use these techniques in my professional career.
