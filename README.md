# About me

Hello! I am Mohil (he/his/him) from India. I am a first year Information System Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. Before pursuing my master's, 
I worked at Deloitte as a Technical Consultant. In this role, I have helped stakeholders identify potential areas of Improvement and build an innovative end-to-end solution for critical business problems. My areas of expertise include working on Microsoft Dynamics CRM and Microsoft Dynamics ERP in the public sector domain. I have also led and developed a product for a US-based regulatory body.  I have driven several initiatives for streamlining and automation of routine administrative tasks. This untapped a newfound passion for product management and business consulting. Fun fact, I love to meet new people and work for various social causes by doing my part in giving back to society.

# What I hope to learn
We all know that data is everywhere and just designing cool stuff like charts or dashboards isn't sufficient but understanding the story behind it and conveying it in words to the right audience is something that I would like to learn. I would also like to learn various data visualizations techniques, tools, and critique methods. Furthermore, I'd like to obtain some hands-on training with these tools and techniques so that I can immediately start implementing what I've learned into my professional career.
