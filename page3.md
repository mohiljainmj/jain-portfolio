# Assignment 3 & 4 Critique by Design

# Introduction 
I decided to critique and redesign the visual on the following link: [COVID - 19 cases around the globe](https://quinterojs.medium.com/covid-19-infection-growth-rates-lagged-mortality-rates-and-other-interesting-statistics-ff39f5408a21)

I chose this visual because I felt that COVID - 19 has become an integral part of our lifestyle. A person for once can get out of his/her house without a mobile phone, but he/she cannot leave the house without a mask and a sanitizer. This visualization was released by Center for Systems Science and Engineering at John Hopkins University. The source for this visualization was built using data from multiple sources, including the WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC, and DXY. The following is a moment-in-time analysis of the coronavirus as of March 4th, 2020. The initial visual is shown below:
