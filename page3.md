# Assignment 3 & 4 Critique by Design

# Step one: Find a Data Visualization

# Introduction 
I decided to critique and redesign the visual on the following link: [COVID - 19 cases around the globe](https://quinterojs.medium.com/covid-19-infection-growth-rates-lagged-mortality-rates-and-other-interesting-statistics-ff39f5408a21)

I chose this visual because I felt that COVID - 19 has become an integral part of our lifestyle. A person for once can get out of his/her house without a mobile phone, but he/she cannot leave the house without a mask and a sanitizer. This visualization was released by Center for Systems Science and Engineering at John Hopkins University. The source for this visualization was built using data from multiple sources, including the WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC, and DXY. The following is a moment-in-time analysis of the coronavirus as of March 4th, 2020. The initial visual is shown below:

# Step two: Critique the Data Visualization

In my opionion, the following things donâ€™t work / can be improved upon in this visual:

1.  The graph can be separated into 4 different bar graphs. As the total number of cases versus the current state is not clear i.e., I am not sure about the total number of confirmed patients in March.
2.  The 'k' on the Y-Axis can be eliminated and can be added in Y-Axis Label.
3.  Instead of showing random dates on the X-Axis, we can group them monthwise. For instance: January, February, March, etc.
4.  There are too many colors in a single graph, which diverts the attention from the actual data. We can separate them in different graphs by displaying different color schemes.
