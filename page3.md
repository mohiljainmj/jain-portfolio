# Assignment 3 & 4 Critique by Design

# Step one: Find a Data Visualization

# Introduction 
I decided to critique and redesign the visual on the following link: [COVID - 19 cases around the globe](https://quinterojs.medium.com/covid-19-infection-growth-rates-lagged-mortality-rates-and-other-interesting-statistics-ff39f5408a21)

I chose this visual because I felt that COVID - 19 has become an integral part of our lifestyle. A person for once can get out of his/her house without a mobile phone, but he/she cannot leave the house without a mask and a sanitizer. This visualization was released by Center for Systems Science and Engineering at John Hopkins University. The source for this visualization was built using data from multiple sources, including the WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC, and DXY. The following is a moment-in-time analysis of the coronavirus as of March 4th, 2020. The initial visual is shown below:

# Step two: Critique the Data Visualization

In my opionion, the following things donâ€™t work / can be improved upon in this visual:

1.  The graph can be separated into 4 different bar graphs. As the total number of cases versus the current state is not clear i.e., I am not sure about the total number of confirmed patients in March.
2.  The 'k' on the Y-Axis can be eliminated and can be added in Y-Axis Label.
3.  Instead of showing random dates on the X-Axis, we can group them monthwise. For instance: January, February, March, etc.
4.  There are too many colors in a single graph, which diverts the attention from the actual data. We can separate them in different graphs by displaying different color schemes. 

# Wireframe 
I created an initital wireframe of my solution, which was a simple pen and paper sketch, as shown below

# Comments
User 1 - 
1. Update the labels of the graphs.
2. Change the name of the dashboard.
3. If we can change the bar chart colors and add different colors for different types of cases. Blue color looks neutral.
4. The graph does not talk about the location.
5. Add numbers at the end of each bar.

User 2 -
1. Rearrange the graphs.
2. Add Active Cases and Recovered Cases widget.
3. Provide a legend for the color used.
4. Titles need to be aligned with what is being displayed.
