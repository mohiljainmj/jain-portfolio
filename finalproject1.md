# Final Project Part 1

# Outline : 
For my final project I thought of talking about what is happiness and how important is it for a country to be happy? I know it seems like an odd question to talk about but, in the recent surveys conducted by [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) the happiness index that we know about has fallen drastically due to many factors over the years. United Nations has worked with Private Organisations, Non-profits and Governments world over to better the world and provide platforms for countries to uplift entire communities. Happiness can and should be perceived as a leading cause of success, prosperity and in some cases even longevity. But there are no known United Nations efforts directed to improve or maintain Happiness Indices of countries. This project is aimed at finding out the significance of various factors in determining the happiness score and happiness rank of a country. It will also list countries that needs assistance with improving the low lying factors.
