# User research and interviews

Q2 - Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
<br>Response - The author critiques the accuracy of the happiness index and if its true happiness of the population using real-life examples such as Finland and Taliban’s take-over of Afghanistan. It further analyses how global average happiness has not been true representative of the population’s happiness by taking the Covid 19 pandemic as an example.

Q3 - Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
<br>Response - It is interesting to see how when the author compares a specific country’s happiness score over a particular timeframe represents the true happiness of the country based on socio-economic and political situation of the country. However, when comparing the global average this is not obvious.

Q4 - Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
<br>Response - Intended audience for this presentation would anyone who is interested to know and understand the real-life relevance of happiness index. One would like to know, if it is the right measure to measure happiness of the population?

<br>Response - This is a report that is trying to tell its audience about how happiness can be measured. It tells us about happiness index a measure that uses several factors like family, freedom, economic prosperity etc. to attach a mean value to happiness. It shows some graphs to make a point.

Q2 - Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
<br>Response - It shows us the values of happiness index over various years across the world. it also uses graphs and maps to further elaborate on specific countries and shows us global average. It also calls to question if happiness index is an accurate measure of happiness.

Q4 - Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
<br>Response - Government of different countries.

Q5 - Is there anything you would change or do differently?
<br>Response -  
1. In the global happiness trends map, you can have a gradient heat map for the countries with varying indexes.
2. You could provide some other filters like top 10 countries with a high index or with a low index
3. For spot evaluations, for family, there is no bar for Afghanistan. Does that mean that the relative number of families is way less as compared to the other and hence no significant data or anything else?
4. For spot evaluations, you could utilize composition charts as well since you have three separate entities to compare for each parameter.
