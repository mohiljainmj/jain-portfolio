# User research and interviews
### Target Audience

Through my project, I thought of talking about what is happiness and how does one calculates the happiness of a nation? Initially, while researching about the project, this seemed like an odd question to talk about but, in the recent surveys conducted by World Happiness Report the world happiness that we know about has fallen drastically due to many factors over the years. The United Nations along with Private Organisations, Non-profits, and Governments have worked together to improve the world and provide platforms for countries to uplift entire communities. Happiness can and should be perceived as a leading cause of success, prosperity, and in some cases even longevity. But there are no known United Nations efforts directed to improve or maintain the Happiness Indices of countries. I will be talking about two countries in my project, Finland and Afghanistan, where Finland is ranked first and Afghanistan is ranked last in the recent survey conducted by World Happiness Report. I will be covering the factors that are involved in such a drastic decline and my target audience would be everyone around the globe. For my interview, I had connected with people from different nationalities and have taken their views on this pressing issue. I aimed to get as many diverse demographics as I could for the interview. I had reached out to my colleagues and their friends.

# Interview 

## Person 1 - 
Q1 - Can you tell me what you think this is?
<br>Response - This is document that explains the concept of Happiness Index and constitutes in its calculation. 

Q2 - Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
<br>Response - The author critiques the accuracy of the happiness index and if its true happiness of the population using real-life examples such as Finland and Taliban’s take-over of Afghanistan. It further analyses how global average happiness has not been true representative of the population’s happiness by taking the Covid 19 pandemic as an example.

Q3 - Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
<br>Response - It is interesting to see how when the author compares a specific country’s happiness score over a particular timeframe represents the true happiness of the country based on socio-economic and political situation of the country. However, when comparing the global average this is not obvious.

Q4 - Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
<br>Response - Intended audience for this presentation would anyone who is interested to know and understand the real-life relevance of happiness index. One would like to know, if it is the right measure to measure happiness of the population?

Q5 - Is there anything you would change or do differently?
<br>Response - I would like the author to pick more country level examples to validate his conclusion of country level happiness index and validate whether happiness index does accurately represent the country’s happiness ?

## Person 2 - 
Q1 - Can you tell me what you think this is?
<br>Response - This is a report that is trying to tell its audience about how happiness can be measured. It tells us about happiness index a measure that uses several factors like family, freedom, economic prosperity etc. to attach a mean value to happiness. It shows some graphs to make a point.

Q2 - Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
<br>Response - It shows us the values of happiness index over various years across the world. it also uses graphs and maps to further elaborate on specific countries and shows us global average. It also calls to question if happiness index is an accurate measure of happiness.

Q3 - Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
<br>Response - It’s surprising to see a continuous upward trend in happiness index and thus happiness since 2017.

Q4 - Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
<br>Response - The intended audience is a group of thought leaders trying to decide if happiness index is the accurate measure of happiness if so, do the trends and numbers support this notion.

Q5 - Is there anything you would change or do differently?
<br>Response - I would supplement the graphs with a summary or inference paragraph which would say what we wish for the audience to interpret from the graphs and possibly cite that in the conclusion.

## Person 3 -
Q1 - Can you tell me what you think this is?
<br>Response - It is basically a statistical representation of the happiness level of the people living in a region bounded by various constraints.

Q2 - Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
<br>Response - It details out the factors considered for the evaluating the happiness index. And then goes out to mention the Average Global Happiness Index Trend. The presentation fulfils its purpose to elaborate these pointers well.

Q3 - Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
<br>Response - Why did the graph rise across the last two years despite the pandemic and losses ? - I was looking for an explanation to that.

Q4 - Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
<br>Response - Government of different countries.

Q5 - Is there anything you would change or do differently?
<br>Response -  
1. In the global happiness trends map, you can have a gradient heat map for the countries with varying indexes.
2. You could provide some other filters like top 10 countries with a high index or with a low index
3. For spot evaluations, for family, there is no bar for Afghanistan. Does that mean that the relative number of families is way less as compared to the other and hence no significant data or anything else?
4. For spot evaluations, you could utilize composition charts as well since you have three separate entities to compare for each parameter.
