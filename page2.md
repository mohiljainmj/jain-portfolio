# Assignment 2 Visualizing Government Debt

### Part 1. Working with web-based visualization tools and data :
The bar chart shown is a chart made avaiable by the Organization Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The below graph shows general government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance.

### Part 2. Working with Flourish :

#### Iteration 1 :
The graph below shows a grid line of charts with one time series chart for each country. However, there is a catch, it gets a bit tricky to compare the ratios for all countries at a glance and analyze how the countries are performing as compared to each other over the years.

#### Iteration 2 :
The below graph shows a scatterplot representation. I have added a filter that displays the graph countrywise. This allows me to understand the Debt to GDP ratio for different countries. The years are ordered in ascending order to draw attention to the variation in values of debt to GDP ratio that occured over the years.

### Summary : 
When considering each type of visualization, it's crucial to consider color as well as the level of "busy-ness." While each way of visualization has benefits and drawbacks, the first and second graphs fall short. The first graph is easy to comprehend. However, it does not account for yearly fluctuations because it is a bar chart. There are a few things that could have been done differently to make the graph convey details more clearly. Firstly, we can remove the background color as it hinders the main focus i.e., the data that is being represented. Secondly, the chart title could have been more clearer as it does not align with the data that is being represented by the bar chart. Lastly, there is no story of what the bar chart is trying to demonstrate to the audience. Though, the grid line chart overcame some of the issues faced in the bar chart, however, the grid line looked over-crowded as we were comparing all the countries in one single chart. In the last visualization, I have used Scatterplot because it shows correlation of the extent of Debt to GDP Ratio and Years. In the OECD data set, I have added a filter that filters the Debt to GDP Ratio on the basis of countries and shows the overall yearly data. Hennce, allows the user to have a clearer picture of the data.
