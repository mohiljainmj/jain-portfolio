# Assignment 2 Visualizing Government Debt

### Part 1. Working with web-based visualization tools and data :
The bar chart shown is a chart made avaiable by the Organization Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The below graph shows general government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance.

### Part 2. Working with Flourish :

#### Iteration 1 :
The graph below shows a grid line of charts with one time series chart for each country. However, there is a catch, it gets a bit tricky to compare the ratios for all countries at a glance and analyze how the countries are performing as compared to each other over the years.

#### Iteration 2 :
The below graph shows a scatterplot reprrsentation. I have added a filter that displays the graph countrywise. This allows me to understand the Debt to GDP ratio for different countries (for a particular year). The data was ordered in descending order to draw attention to high values of debt to GDP ratio. Ideally, I would have wanted to have a sequential color scheme throughout the bars, with darker colors indicating higher ratio values and lighter colors indicating low values. But, this was not possible to achieve in Flourish.
